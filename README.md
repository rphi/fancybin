FancyBin
========

This is a little Django app which offers a very straightforward pastebin service, using the 
Microsoft Monaco library to provide a rich editor and syntax highlighting.

It uses Parcel to preprocess and bundle up all of the static assets and vendor packages.

Assuming you've got Yarn on your path, running `localdevstart.sh` should handle everything 
for you to get a local copy of FancyBin running on your machine.
